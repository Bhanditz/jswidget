This code is an example of how to integrate with the Creative Commons 
JsWidget.

== WARNING ==

This is just a preview!  YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON IT!

It's not even a betta, nor in beta.  It's a glimpse into the 
ever-changing future.  No warranty is provided; this software may eat 
your cat, spill your milk, and prepare your breakfast.  Or it may not!

== What is JsWidget? ==

The JsWidget is a JavaScript file hosted on creativecommons.org that 
displays a user interface for selecting a Creative Commons license.  We 
wrote it so that if you didn't want to write your own interface, you 
could just call ours.

We think it's so nice that we're going to make our web app things use it 
eventually.

== Jurisdictions ==

JsWidget comes with support for different jurisdictions.  If a user of 
it wants to select a license customized for a particular country's 
copyright law, the interface will handle that properly and will 
automatically update as the international CC licenses are localized or 
updated.

== Languages ==

In this preview edition, there is only support for US English.  In the 
future, you can select a language with the ?locale= option to 
complete.js.

== Style ==

We give you two style files that make it look bearable.  You probably 
want to customize these so the form has the colors and styles your users 
expect.

== Re-use ==

See COPYING for information on copying/reusing this work.  Basically, do 
whatever you want.

== Questions ==

Ask us questions about this!  Email our development mailing list 
cc-devel@lists.ibiblio.org .
